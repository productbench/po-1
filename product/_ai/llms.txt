# PO-1: Product Context Repository

> A structured folder system for product managers to organize context for AI-powered workflows.

## Quick Start

Start here:
- `/product/overview.md` — What we're building (current state)
- `/strategy/current/vision.md` — Where we're headed
- `/.ai/CLAUDE.md` — How to work with me

## Repository Structure

```
├── .ai/          → Skills and instructions for AI assistants
├── product/      → Current product state (source of truth)
├── discovery/    → Research and insights
├── strategy/     → Vision, goals, roadmap
├── execution/    → PRDs, specs, active work
├── operations/   → Team, processes, decisions
├── workbench/    → Temporary workspace (WIP, ideas)
└── archive/      → Long-term storage
```

## Folder Purposes

### /.ai/
AI instructions and reusable skills. Read `CLAUDE.md` or `.cursorrules` first to understand preferences, terminology, and how to help effectively.

### /product/
The product *as it exists today*. Single source of truth for what we've built, who uses it, and how it works. Always current.

### /discovery/
What we're learning. User research, competitive analysis, market insights. Evidence that informs decisions.

### /strategy/
Where we're going. Vision (long-term), goals/OKRs (quarterly), and roadmap. The "why" behind what we build.

### /execution/
What we're shipping. Active PRDs, specs, and user stories. Recently shipped work. The "how" of building.

### /operations/
How we work. Team structure, processes, meeting notes, and decision records (ADRs).

### /workbench/
Scratch space. Ideas, experiments, drafts. Things that haven't found their home yet.

### /archive/
Historical context. Completed research, past goals, shipped features (6+ months old), old meeting notes.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/.ai/CLAUDE.md` | AI instructions and preferences |
| `/product/overview.md` | Product summary and value prop |
| `/strategy/current/vision.md` | Long-term product direction |
| `/strategy/current/goals-okrs.md` | Current objectives |
| `/strategy/current/roadmap.md` | What's planned and when |
| `/operations/team/team-charter.md` | Team mission and agreements |

## Navigation Tips

**For product questions:** Start with `/product/overview.md`, then explore `/product/` subfolders.

**For strategic context:** Read `/strategy/current/` files in order: vision → goals → roadmap.

**For active work:** Check `/execution/active/` for PRDs in progress.

**For research:** Browse `/discovery/ongoing/` for evergreen insights, `/discovery/projects/` for active research.

**For process questions:** See `/operations/processes/` for how things get done.

**For historical context:** Search `/archive/` with the relevant subfolder (discovery, strategy, execution, operations).

## Content Freshness

| Folder | Update Frequency |
|--------|-----------------|
| `/product/` | When features ship or change |
| `/discovery/ongoing/` | Continuously |
| `/strategy/current/` | Quarterly (goals), monthly (roadmap) |
| `/execution/active/` | Daily/weekly during development |
| `/operations/` | As processes change |
| `/workbench/` | Ad hoc |

## For AI Assistants

1. **Read `/.ai/CLAUDE.md` first** for preferences and terminology
2. **Check `/product/overview.md`** for product context
3. **Reference specific folders** based on the task:
   - Writing PRDs → `/execution/`, `/.ai/templates/`
   - Research synthesis → `/discovery/`
   - Strategic alignment → `/strategy/current/`
   - Process questions → `/operations/`
4. **Link your sources** when referencing documents
5. **Suggest updates** if you notice outdated information
